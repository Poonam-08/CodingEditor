# Python Code Editor with Terminal Integration

This project provides a Python code editor running in the browser with an integrated terminal to run Python code. The editor uses Monaco Editor for code editing and Pyodide to run Python code directly in the browser without the need for a server. The terminal displays the output of the Python code, including custom print statements and handling for user input via `input()`.

## Features
- **Python Code Execution**: Run Python code directly in the browser using Pyodide.
- **Monaco Editor**: A fast and feature-rich code editor with syntax highlighting for Python.
- **Input Handling**: Dynamic input fields generated from `input()` calls in the code, with user validation.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages in the terminal if inputs are missing, with validation split into two lines for clarity.
- **Terminal Output**: Custom terminal to show Python program output and errors.

## Demo
You can try out the editor and run Python code directly from the browser. Check out the live demo at:
